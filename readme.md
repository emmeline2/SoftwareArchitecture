Hi I'm Emmeline. I am in my 3rd quarter of the MSCS program at Drexel. I did my undergrad degree at Case Western Reserve University in Computer Engineering. 
After graduating I worked for three years as an Embedded Software Engineer developing firmware for Programmable Logic Controllers(PLCs). 
I decided to go back to school this fall to pivot to focus on more full stack development. Outside of school/work I like to spend time outside: rowing, running and hiking. 

From this course I would like to learn more about how architecture decisions get made. I would also like to learn more about cloud architecture because I have not had experience working with it before.
